# Okyaku

## Pay Once. Own Forever. No Subscriptions.

### The AI-Enabled CRM & Marketing Hub That Doesn't Charge You Every Month

---

## Stop Renting Your Business Tools

**What if you could buy your CRM like you buy software—once?**

Every month, businesses hemorrhage money on SaaS subscriptions:
- $45/user for basic CRM access
- $100+/user for "professional" features
- $500+/month just to unlock AI capabilities
- Multiplied by every person on your team
- Forever

**That's not a tool. That's a tax on doing business.**

Okyaku is different. One purchase. Full ownership. Every feature included—including AI.

## The Subscription Trap: What You're Really Paying

### The Hidden Cost of "Affordable" Monthly Plans

| Scenario | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **HubSpot** (5 users, Professional) | $5,400 | $16,200 | $27,000 |
| **Salesforce** (5 users + AI) | $9,000 | $27,000 | $45,000 |
| **Pipedrive** (5 users + add-ons) | $3,600 | $10,800 | $18,000 |
| **Okyaku** | **One-time** | **Same price** | **Still the same** |

That "affordable" $50/month per user becomes **$3,000 per person** over 5 years.

For a 10-person sales team on a mid-tier CRM with AI features, you're looking at **$60,000+ over 5 years**—and you never own anything. Miss a payment? Lose access to your own customer data.

## AI Without the AI Tax

### The Dirty Secret of "AI-Powered" CRMs

When competitors advertise AI features, here's what they don't tell you:

1. **It's an add-on** — AI features cost $50-200/user/month extra
2. **It's metered** — Pay per API call, per generation, per analysis
3. **Your data leaves** — Every AI request sends customer data to external servers
4. **You're training their models** — Your business intelligence improves their product

### Okyaku's AI: Yours Completely

Okyaku runs AI locally using Ollama and open-source models like Llama 3.1. This means:

- **Zero per-use costs** — Generate 10 posts or 10,000. Same price: free
- **Complete privacy** — AI runs on your hardware. Data never leaves
- **No API limits** — No throttling, no quotas, no surprise bills
- **Your hardware, your rules** — Upgrade models anytime at no cost

**The same AI capabilities that cost $500+/month elsewhere are included and unlimited.**

## The Math Is Simple

### 5-Year Total Cost of Ownership

**Traditional SaaS Route (10-person team):**

| Item | Monthly | 5-Year Total |
|------|---------|--------------|
| CRM subscription | $500 | $30,000 |
| Email marketing add-on | $200 | $12,000 |
| Social media tool | $300 | $18,000 |
| AI features add-on | $500 | $30,000 |
| **Total** | **$1,500/mo** | **$90,000** |

**Okyaku Route:**

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Okyaku license | One-time |
| Server (cloud or on-prem) | ~$100-300/mo |
| **5-Year Total** | **$6,000-18,000** |

**Savings: $72,000 - $84,000 over 5 years**

That's money back in your business, not padding a SaaS company's recurring revenue.
